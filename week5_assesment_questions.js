1. 
magine you are working on a project that involves building a Calculator using javascript. The calculator performs basic operations (addition, subtraction, division and multiplication). As a responsible developer, you want to ensure the calculator works correctly.
a. How would you approach testing the Calculator using jest? Please decsribe the steps you would take. (15marks)
b. Can you provide an example of a Jest test case for any of the arithmetic operations in the Calculator? Explain what the test is checking for. (10 marks)
c. List common Jest matchers you might use in your test cases. (5 marks)



3.
You are working on a project that involves building a Phonebook service in a Nodejs application. The phone book allows you to store and retrieve contact information. As part of the testing process, you need to set up a connection to a databse before running any tests and clean up any resources after all tests when all test have completed.

Write the code for the test suite.

Establish conection to the database using connectToDatabase(). (10 marks)
Create some initial contacts for testing by seeding the database using addContact(). (5 marks)
Tip: it should be an array of contacts i.e an array of contact object.
Test that a contact can be added succefully using addContact(). (5 marks)
Test that retrieving contact by name returns correct information using getContactByName(). (5 marks)
Note getContactByName() takes a name as an argument and so a name should be passed to it when called.
Clean up resources when all tests are done running by using closeDatabaseConnection(). (8 marks)
Test that the contact is no longer in the database (5 marks)
It is important to note that connectToDatabase() , addContact(), getContactByName() and closeDatabaseConnection() are all phoneBookService methods and they all return promises.
